% those those found in the original DEM as well as those resulting from
% filling/merging operations. In the case of flat areas resulting from
% filling/merging operations, the outlet cell index and the direction which
% the outlet will overflow toward may be specified. In the case of initial
% flat pit bottoms in the original DEM, the first cell that is found in a
% flat area is handed in and the direction of this cell should be specified
% as a -1 (pit resulting from elevation rather than drainaga) and the
% adjacent flat cells shall be directed toward this pit.
