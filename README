This repository contains MatLab code for the watershed delineation algorithm developed for the Purdue University Watershed Management Apps group. This repository includes several MatLab M-files, Lidar elevation data from several Indiana locations in the form of .las files and their respective M-files saving this data after loading them in as MatLab variables, and contrived cases developed in Microsoft Excel and saved as seperate .csv files for each test case.
